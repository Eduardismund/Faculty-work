# Written Exam

Another exam where I completed the exam just as the allocated time expired. The exam wasn't necessarily hard but was quite extensive, especially the third exercise. Therefore, I recommend starting with that one. In the [`exerciseII`](exerciseII/) folder, I put several exercises for exercise no. 2, that require the ouput or to change something in order for them to work.
## Notes

- **Subjects Covered:** I have included most of the subjects given this year.
- **Subject 915:** For the final exercise, it was the "Ice Cream" exercise.
