# Dynamical Systems

I found this course to encourage mechanical learning, as it pretty much forced you to use limited methods for solving problems. It was mostly low-key stressful and didn't require that much work. The labs were utterly pointless. The seminars were okay, but I didn't see the point of the seminar test, as many topics were included in the written exam as well.

The exams given this year are in the ['Exams'](Exams/) folder.
