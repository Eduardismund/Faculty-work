# Exams

The written exam was partially okay. This year, the professor changed the subjects, so it was a bit unexpected, but it was still manageable. I do not have the Retake Exam, but I know it involved some IVP and expressing it using an error function for the first exercise. The second exercise required some solving of a linear system and then representing it using polar coordinates (which I wasn't prepared for). The third exercise invloved Newton-Raphson.
