# Graph Algorithms

The most pointless course and exam so far. I attended the first lecture, which perfectly showcased how the rest of the semester's lectures would be, and I hold the same grudge for the seminars too. If it weren't for the cheatsheet and the repetition of the same subjects year after year, perhaps it would have been more challenging and enjoyable. As it stands, it feels completely useless.

I've put my assignments in the ['Assignments'](Assignments/) folder and the exams from my current year in the ['Exams'](Exams/) folder.
