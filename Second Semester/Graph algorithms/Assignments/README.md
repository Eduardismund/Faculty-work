# Assignments

The assignments contributed to the final grade, their median having a 40% impact on the final grade. They were solved one after another in the same project.

I've also solved the bonus which required implementing the first assignment in C++ (adding approximately 0.5 points to the **final** grade).
## Assignments information

- **Assignment 1**:
  - **Task:** Design and implement an abstract data type directed graph with operations for getting the number of vertices, iterating over vertices and edges, checking and retrieving edge existence and properties, modifying the graph (adding/removing vertices and edges), copying the graph, reading from and writing to a text file, and creating a random graph.
  - **Grade:** 10/10

- **Assignment 2**:
  - **Task:** Write a program that, given a directed graph and two vertices, finds a shortest path between them using a forward breadth-first search from the starting vertex.
  - **Grade:** 10/10

- **Assignment 3**:
  - **Task:** Write a program that, given a graph with costs and two vertices, finds a lowest-cost walk between the given vertices or prints a message if there are negative cost cycles accessible from the starting vertex. The program will use a matrix defined as d[x,k] = the cost of the lowest-cost walk from s to x with length at most k, where s is the starting vertex.
  - **Grade:** 10/10

- **Assignment 4**:
  - **Task:** Write a program that, given an undirected connected graph, constructs a minimal spanning tree using Prim's algorithm.
  - **Grade:** 10/10

- **Assignment 5**:
  - **Task:** Given an undirected graph with costs, find a Hamiltonian cycle of low cost (approximate TSP) using the heuristic of taking, from the current vertex, the edge of minimum cost that does not close a cycle of length less than n.
  - **Grade:** 10/10
