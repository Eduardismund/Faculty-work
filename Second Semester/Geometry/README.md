# Geometry

I had a great experience with this subject, though the lectures weren't worth attending. The seminars, however, were very helpful. Iulia Groza has almost all the solutions, so I don't find it necessary to repost them here, even if they are slightly modified from what she has in her Repository. The exams were manageable, and the theory was as expected. (If you have the seminar with Micu, ask him to prove Euler-Rodriguez's Theorem for my enjoyment, please! ðŸ˜­)
