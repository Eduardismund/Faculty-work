Write a C program that will read from keyboard lowercased strings (until X is written).
The main process will start two types of Child processes: A and B started every time a string is read from the keyboard


Child processes A.
    The parent will send the string to the created child process using pipes.

    Each child process will initiate a vector V with 26 zeros and will iterate over the string character by character trying to compute an index considering the ASCII code of a character:
    a (97) -> 0
    b (98) -> 1
    c (99) -> 2
    etc.

    This index corresponds to a position in vector V that will have to be incremented during each character iteration.
    This frequency vector for the characters found in the string will be send back:
        - to the parent using pipes that will print it on the screen.
        - to the process B

Child processes B:
    Will receive the frequency vector from the a child process A with a pipe and it will sum up all the values and print the
