1) Write a shell script that will receive as command line arguments a list of possible files or usernames.
    - if the argument indicates the name of an existing file (recursive), it will store in a file named file-reports.info the full path of the file, its size and the last modified date.
    - if the argument indicates the name of an existing test usernames (you can use /etc/passwd), it will store in a file named user-reports.info the username and its group.
    - if it was not found a file/user with the value of the argument, the script will store the values in a file name errors-report.info

    At the end, the script will have to print an info message telling what was the percentage of arguments that were files, usernames or none of them.

Note: file-reports.info, user-reports.info, errors-report.info must be created if they do not exist.

2) Sa se scrie un script care numara cate fisiere cu extensia *.txt din directorul curent contin TOATE cuvintele date ca parametri. Se vor efectua toate validarile necesare!

3) Write a script shell that receives command line arguments as follows:
The first argument is a file containg text.
The secound argument is a string.
The third argument is an email address.
The rest of the arguments are also email addresses.
For each email address recived as an agrument, except the third argument
the script will generate a file named:
message-<email address here>
Each file created will contain the following:

From: <insert email received as the third argument here>
To: <insert email address here>
<insert the text from the file received as the first argument here>

Delivered on <day>/<month>/<year>

where day month year takne from the system current time.

After creating the files the script will group all the files in directoies,
each direcotory will be named after the domains of the email addresses given
as arguments (the domain of an email address is the that part of the email
that comes after @ ex: yahoo.com gmail.com scs.ubbcluj.ro)

The following command can be used to solve this problem:
while
for
mv
date
cut
