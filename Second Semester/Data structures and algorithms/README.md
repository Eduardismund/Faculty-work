# Data structures and algorithms

I really enjoyed this subject. The lectures were well-structured, making the concepts understandable from the start if you paid enough attention. The seminars were both entertaining and helpful. Answering five questions during the seminar resulted in 0.5 bonus points at the end of the semester. The laboratories were also excellent for keeping the information fresh. Overall, I'm really happy with what I learned in this course.
