# Data structures and algorithms

I really enjoyed this subject. The lectures were well-structured, making the concepts understandable from the start if you paid enough attention. It's useful to note that they have been recorded on YouTube, so you can watch [Lect. ONET-MARIAN Zsuzsanna](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbvFU-3IcS0EZZNMJfkpm7NlXenMQhtxS) or [Lect. LUPSA Dana](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8YrC0llBTysIIaErLeoGBu6lN9jT-fQf) kick those Data Structures! The seminars were both entertaining and helpful. Answering five questions during the seminar resulted in 0.5 bonus points at the end of the semester. The laboratories were a nice exercise and can be found in the ['Assignments'](Assignments/) folder and a few exam models in the ['Exams'](Exams/) folder. Overall, I'm really happy with what I've learned in this course.
