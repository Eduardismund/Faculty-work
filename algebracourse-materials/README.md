During the Algebra Course, I have worked on the following optional projects:\n
->Project 2: Inputing a non-zero natural number n, show the number of associative operations on a set A = {a1,..,an} and the operation table of each operation (for n <=4).
->Project 4: Inputing a non-zero natural number n, compute the number of k-dimensional subspaces of the n-dimensional vector space over the field 𝑍2 over the finite field 𝑍2 and a basis of each subspace.
->Project 5: Inputing two natural numbers m and n>=2, compute the number of matrices A belonging to M m,n in reduced echalion form and the matrices(for 2<=m and n<=5)
