# Algebra Course Projects

During the Algebra Course, I have worked on the following optional projects:

## Projects Overview

- **Project 2**: 
  - Input a non-zero natural number \( n \) and show the number of associative operations on a set \( A = \{a_1, \ldots, a_n\} \) and the operation table of each operation (for \( n \leq 4 \)).

- **Project 4**: 
  - Input a non-zero natural number \( n \) and compute the number of \( k \)-dimensional subspaces of the \( n \)-dimensional vector space over the field \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) and a basis of each subspace.

- **Project 5**: 
  - Input two natural numbers \( m \) and \( n \geq 2 \) and compute the number of matrices \( A \) belonging to \( M_{m,n} \) in reduced echelon form and the matrices (for \( 2 \leq m \) and \( n \leq 5 \)).
