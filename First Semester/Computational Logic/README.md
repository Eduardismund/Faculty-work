# Computational Logic

Nothing particularly special happened during the semester. Thereâ€™s a lot of memorization required to do well on the final exam, which is a significant part of the final grade. The midterm in the 5th week covered addition, subtraction, and other operations in different bases, as well as conversions. In the 'Exams' folder, I've included plenty of final exam subjects that typically remain consistent over the years.

I highly recommend doing the bonus assignment, it would have really boosted my grade!
