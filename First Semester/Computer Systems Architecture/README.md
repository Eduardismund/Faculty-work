# Computer Systems Architecture

I no longer have any ASM exercises from the laboratory. I found them largely unhelpful, especially given how the laboratory was held by Professor Rosian (I’d advise avoiding this professor if possible). I’ve included a few subjects for the written and practical exams in the 'Exams' folder.

The midterm is way too overrated so don't stress about it. The most overwhelming part of this subject is the 4-hour long final exam!
