# Computer Systems Architecture

I no longer have any ASM exercises from the laboratory. I found them largely unhelpful, especially given how the laboratory was held by Professor Rosian (I’d advise avoiding this professor if possible). I’ve included a few subjects for the written and practical exams in the ['Exams'](Exams/) folder.

The midterm is way too overrated so don't stress about it. The most overwhelming part of this subject is the 4-hour long final exam!

In the ['Theory'](Theory/) folder, you'll find a few essays that I’ve structured, using information from Vancea's materials. There is a rumour that the theory subjects are not repeated and it's been true for the most part. Flags for retake!
