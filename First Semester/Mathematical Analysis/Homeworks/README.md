# Mathematical Analysis Homework

The homework assignments contributed to the final grade, being worth 1 point. The final grade component for homework was calculated as the arithmetic median of the best 8 scores out of all assignments.

Extra homework assignments also contributed 1 point to the final grade if all of them were completed. For the secondary homework, I completed the extra assignment and received an additional 0.16 or so points towards the final grade.
