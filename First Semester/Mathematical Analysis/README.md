# Mathematical Analysis

Throughout the Mathematical Analysis course, I completed 13 homework assignments corresponding to each week's seminar. These assignments can be found in the ['Homeworks'](Homeworks/) folder.

Additionally, I have included photos of both the Midterm and Final exam in the ['Exams'](Exams/) folder.

For the activity portion of the grade, 4 answers meant 1 point added to the final grade.
