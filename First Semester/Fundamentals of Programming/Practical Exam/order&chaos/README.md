# Order and Chaos Game

## Overview

**Order and Chaos** is a strategy game played on a 6x6 board. The two players are:
- **Order** (human player) who wins by aligning 5 consecutive pieces of the same type in a row, column, or diagonal.
- **Chaos** (computer player) who wins if the board is filled up without Order achieving the alignment.
