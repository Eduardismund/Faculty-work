# Fundamentals of Programming

The most useful yet time-consuming course this semester. All the assignments are posted in the ['Assignments'](Assignments/) folder. For the written exam, I have provided a few subjects from this year in the ['Written Exam'](Written%20Exam/) folder. For the practical exam, the ['Practical Exam'](Practical%20Exam) folder. Top tier subject!
