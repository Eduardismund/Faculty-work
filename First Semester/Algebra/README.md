# Algebra Course Projects

During the Algebra Course, I have worked on the following optional projects:

- **Project 2**: 
  Input a non-zero natural number \( n \). Show the number of associative operations on a set \( A = \{a1, a2,..., an\} \) and the operation table of each operation (for  n <= 4 ).

- **Project 4**: 
  Input a non-zero natural number \( n \). Compute the number of \( k \)-dimensional subspaces of the \( n \)-dimensional vector space over the field \( Z_2 \) and provide a basis for each subspace.

- **Project 5**: 
  Input two natural numbers \( m \) and \( n >= 2 \). Compute the number of matrices \( A \) belonging to \( M_{m,n} \) in reduced echelon form and list the matrices (for \( m \<= 5 \) and \( 2 \<= n \<= 5 \)).

  Aditionally, in the folder 'Exams' there can be found a few exams both from the Midterm and the final exam.
