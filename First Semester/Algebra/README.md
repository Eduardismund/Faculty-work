# Algebra

For this course, besides the 14 seminaries, I have worked on 3 optional projects which led to a better grade and can be found in the ['Projects'](Projects/) folder.

Besides that, I was able to provide a few exam models from this year, both from the midterm and the final exam, which can be found in the ['Exams'](Exams/) folder.
