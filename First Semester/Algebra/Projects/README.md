# Projects

During the Algebra Course, I have worked on the following optional projects for a bonus of 0.6p added to the final grade:

- **Project 2 (Graded 0.2/0.2)**: 
  Input a non-zero natural number \( n \). Show the number of associative operations on a set \( A = \{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\} \) and the operation table of each operation (for \( n \leq 4 \)).

- **Project 4 (Graded 0.2/0.2)**: 
  Input a non-zero natural number \( n \). Compute the number of \( k \)-dimensional subspaces of the \( n \)-dimensional vector space over the field \( \mathbb{Z}_2 \) and provide a basis for each subspace.

- **Project 5 (Graded 0.2/0.2)**: 
  Input two natural numbers \( m \) and \( n \geq 2 \). Compute the number of matrices \( A \) belonging to \( M_{m,n} \) in reduced echelon form and list the matrices (for \( 2 \leq m \leq 5 \) and \( 2 \leq n \leq 5 \)).
