# Projects

During the Algebra course, I worked on several optional projects, which contributed a bonus of 0.6 points to the final grade. Below are the projects and their respective grades:

- **Project 2 (Graded 0.2/0.2)**:  
  Input a non-zero natural number `n`. Show the number of associative operations on a set `A = {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n}` and the operation table of each operation (for `n` up to 4).

- **Project 4 (Graded 0.2/0.2)**:  
  Input a non-zero natural number `n`. Compute the number of `k`-dimensional subspaces of the `n`-dimensional vector space over the field `Z_2` and provide a basis for each subspace.

- **Project 5 (Graded 0.2/0.2)**:  
  Input two natural numbers `m` and `n` (where `n` is at least 2). Compute the number of matrices `A` belonging to `M_{m,n}` in reduced echelon form and list the matrices (for `m` between 2 and 5, and `n` between 2 and 5).
